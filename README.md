# 💖 Wanna Go Out With Me 💖 

Welcome to **"Wanna Go Out With Me ?"**, a fun and interactive web page designed to bring smiles and laughter! 🎉  

## 🌟 Project Overview  
This project is a playful way to ask someone out in a cute and engaging manner. The webpage features an adorable **Bugcat Capoo** GIF and two buttons – **"Yes"** and **"No"** – but there's a twist! 😆  

### 💡 How It Works:  
- If the user hovers over **"No"**, the button starts **moving away** randomly, making it impossible to click!  
- Eventually, the user is left with no choice but to press **"Yes"**! ❤️  
- Clicking **"Yes"** changes the text to a heartwarming confirmation message and redirects to a **yes.html** page.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **HTML** – Structure of the webpage  
- **CSS** – Styling and layout design  
- **JavaScript** – Button interactions and animations
